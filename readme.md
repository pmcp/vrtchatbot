Not much to see here: I just used this repo as a cdn for a project involving a chatbot.

The project was a bot we wrote from scratch, and a small CMS to go with it. The project was funded by Google DNI, and we did it together with the VRT sports brand, Sporza.

We made it together with https://oakwood.ai/technologies/bottist/.
